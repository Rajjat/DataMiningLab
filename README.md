# DataMiningLab
This lab project deals with sequential pattern mining. Usually mining offrequent patterns from the sequential database results in a huge amount ofpatterns in the output. In this project we are assigned with a task of reducingsuch a bulk amount of patterns by using the concept of delta domination.Though the ’theory of relevance’ approach decreases the volume of resulting frequent patterns significantly, here we want to re-implement it with the help of delta domination concept. In doing so, we have tried and examined if our adopted approach of delta domination results in the further reduction of the set of patterns. On successful implementation of Relevant Sequence Miner algorithm with the delta domination, we have obtained positive results.
